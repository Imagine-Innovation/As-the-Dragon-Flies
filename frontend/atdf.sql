(1, 'A familiar face', 'On several occasions, you noticed someone following you. You have seen this person many times, but never spoken to them. The few times you tried to approach him, he disappeared. So you wonder what this person wants from you, and why he is following you.'),
(2, 'Abandoned orphan', 'You were abandoned at a very young age and have no idea who your parents are. You lived like a wanderer in the countryside, moving from village to village. You worked on various farms most of your childhood and adolescence.'),
(3, 'Adopted by a different race', 'You never knew who your real parents are and were adopted by a race different from yours. Although you do not look like those who raised you, you have adopted the culture and ways of your adopted race (for example you are a dwarf but you act and think like an elf).'),
(4, 'Adopted child of monks', 'You never knew who your real parents were and had grown up in a monastery, where the monks always treated you adorable. They have become your friends, your teachers, your parents. Now you can\'t wait to see the world.'),
(5, 'Adopted son of a dragon', 'You were raised by a good dragon (or other extremely intelligent and powerful creature) and taught to think like one. You respect dragons for what they are, crafty and intelligent creatures, but you have also learned to avoid, perhaps even fear, evil dragons.'),
(6, 'Adopted son of artisans', 'You never knew your real parents and were raised by your aunt and uncle, who could not have a \'child. They gave you everything a child could dream of having. Yet there is still a void in your life and you would like to know who your biological parents are.'),
(7, 'Adopted son of nobles', 'You were born into the nobility but your mother died giving birth to you, and you never knew your father, who is died at sea when you were very young. So it was your grandfather who raised you, alone. He pampered you and gave you everything, but when he died it was your uncle who inherited all his goods and properties, before forcing you to leave the estate.'),
(8, 'Adopted son of peasants', 'Your parents died when you were still an infant and it was your aunt and uncle, who had many children, who raised you. But most of your \"brothers or sisters\" did everything to make you feel like you weren\'t family. So you are happy to say goodbye and want to prove to them that you are much better than them.'),
(9, 'Amnesia', 'You don\'t know who you are or where you come from. You don\'t even remember your parents and don\'t know if you have brothers or sisters. Your past is a total mystery... that you will discover little by little...'),
(10, 'Ancestral dispute', 'You belong to a rich or noble family that has been in dispute with an important clan over a complicated matter for decades, even centuries. Although you don\'t understand all the details of the case, you grew up hating this feuding family. However, before you do anything drastic, you have decided to get to the bottom of this matter and are now fighting to uncover the truth.'),
(11, 'Animal companion', 'When you were very young, you made friends with an animal. This animal has always been your friend, and you were always there for him as much as he was for you. You would cross an entire continent to protect your mate and members of its species.'),
(12, 'Apprentice carpenter', 'You were trained as a carpenter by your father or someone else in your community. You have learned to build strong structures and know how to use a hammer.'),
(13, 'Apprentice mason', 'You were trained as a mason, by your father or by another person in your community. You have a gift for building things and solving math problems. You may also be stronger than average, from all those years spent in construction.'),
(14, 'Apprentice thief', 'You were raised or trained by one of the biggest pickpockets in the city (according to him) and learned to live among the crowds. So you stole a lot in your youth, and can be proud of it or, on the contrary, ashamed, in which case you could be repentant and devoted to repairing your past sins.'),
(15, 'Banished', 'Your parents were kicked out of their home by their family, and were never allowed to return. Although aware of why they were banned, you strongly believe that they were incorrectly convicted and want to prove their innocence. One day you will clear your parents\' name of all suspicion and allow them to return home'),
(16, 'Big secret', 'Someone dear to you died in your arms. In his last breath, he revealed to you the location of a hidden treasure, which only he knew. Since then, many strangers have followed you, and some might even have tried to capture you. You know they want to know the location of the treasure, and you can\'t get there because you\'d be followed... One day, though, you will.'),
(17, 'Birth prophesied', 'Your birth was predicted and you are destined to do great things. Although you do not yet know what these great things are, you know that one day you will face great adversity, and that your future actions can have a direct impact on the fate of the entire world.'),
(18, 'Birthright', 'A minor artifact was given to you upon the death of your parents. You do not yet know its powers but, like your father and your grandfather before him, you will one day be obliged to use it to fight against Evil. You are not looking forward to this day.'),
(19, 'Blessed by the gods', 'When you were a baby, you survived an accident that should have cost you your life. Since then, the people of your tribe or village are convinced that a god has blessed you and that you are, in one way or another, destined for an exceptional future. You hope not to disappoint them, but suspect that you are nothing special.'),
(20, 'Burnt witch', 'As a child, your mother was accused of vile witchcraft and sentenced to death. She was burned alive before your eyes, but you were too young, too weak and too terrified to intervene. Soon after, you left your house, vowing never to return.'),
(21, 'Child of a famous adventurer', 'You are the child of an adventurer whose name and reputation precede you. However, this is nothing compared to this powerful enemy who seeks revenge on your father, using you as bait.'),
(22, 'Child of a Witch', 'You are the child of an evil witch who has abused you and tormented you to no end. You grew up hating your mother and fearing people like her. When you were older, you ran away from your home. You now wish to never cross paths with your mother again.'),
(23, 'Child of an evil cleric', 'Your father was a cleric of an evil deity, and although he always treated you fairly (at least as much as one can imagine from an evil man), you grew up hating his god and his servants. So you\'re happy to leave home and hope you never see your father or one of his faithful sidekicks again.'),
(24, 'Child of gypsies', 'You grew up in a gypsy clan and have traveled all your life. Although you are now gone, you continue to follow their different traditions and way of life.'),
(25, 'Child of slayers', 'You come from a long line of slayers (demons, dragons, giants, orcs, ...) and your family is renowned for its many exploits. Your ancestors foiled many evil plans in their time, and it is with joy that you continue this family tradition. However, you fear that one day you will pay for all the feats of arms of your family and yours.'),
(26, 'City orphan', 'For as long as you can remember, you have always lived on the streets of a big city. You never knew your parents and have no idea who they were. You are today a resourceful individual who knows every nook and dark alley of this city, in which you grew up.'),
(27, 'Companion of a mythical beast', 'You saved the life of a magical beast. Although you have little control over it, and you may not see each other for weeks or even months, this beast is your best friend and greatest ally.'),
(28, 'Cook', 'You spent your adolescence working as an assistant cook for the local tavern or large inn near your home village, for a major local temple, or for a manor noble. Now you know how to prepare and cook any dish for delicate people who are ready to pay a lot for it.'),
(29, 'Divine favor', 'Long ago, your mother sacrificed her life to help a god or other powerful entity. This entity now considers that it owes a debt to you, as your mother\'s heir. One day he will pay you back.'),
(30, 'Divine parents', 'You are the fruit of the union between a mortal and a god. Although you have inherited few, if any, powers from your divine parent, you feel destined for a better life and perhaps believe that you deserve a place at his side. However, this parent is not very inclined to accept you among their kind, and may even see you as a potential threat.'),
(31, 'Domestic slave', 'You grew up as a slave, working in a noble\'s mansion (cooking, serving food, cleaning, etc). Although you were treated quite well, you are still happy to have been able to buy your freedom and a new life begins for you. Now you want to help other slaves gain their freedom.'),
(32, 'Evil magician\'s assistant', 'Although you may not have the gift, you served a wizard in your youth, and learned many things about magic from him . The man, however, was evil, and made your life such hell that you had to run away. Your experience now naturally causes you to distrust all magicians, and you will have to work to learn to trust one of them.'),
(33, 'Family quest', 'One of your parents was an adventurer. On his deathbed he whispered a name to you that you had never heard before. Ever since, you\'ve been obsessed with finding out what that name means (a person, a place), and you\'ve been trying hard to guess or figure out what your parent wanted you to find with that one clue.'),
(34, 'Famous gladiator', 'As far as you remember, you have always been a gladiator and you delight the crowds. Although you may have been a slave at first, you long ago purchased your freedom, but continue to risk your life fighting for gold, glory, and passion. Your face is known in the city where you used to fight.'),
(35, 'Fisherman', 'You were born by the sea or lake, and were trained in fishing by one of your parents or another person in your community. You know how to sail small boats, guess what the weather will be like tomorrow, and maybe even how to navigate using the stars.'),
(36, 'Former thief', 'You were once a member of a large thieves\' guild. One day you refused to steal an item from the temple of a deity you respect. And, when you later learned that other members of the guild had finally done the job for you, you stole the item in question from them and returned it to its owners. Since that day, you have been on the run.'),
(37, 'Galley slave', 'You were taken from your parents by a band of pirates. For years you were chained and forced to follow the beat of a drum while rowing, rowing and rowing. During a collision, you were one day able to escape. But you have sworn to take revenge on these pirates.'),
(38, 'Gladiator slave', 'You are the child of a slave and grew up in a gladiator school. There you learned how to use exotic weapons and draw enough blood to please the crowd. But although your skills have allowed you to survive thus far, the life of a gladiator is not for you, and so it is fortunate that you have gained your freedom to start a new life.'),
(39, 'Highway robber', 'You were part of a band of highwaymen who attacked caravans and rich nobles as well as peasants. Since then, you have grown up and realized the wrong path you were on. You are now working to correct the mistakes you made during your youth'),
(40, 'Illegitimate child', 'You are the illegitimate child of a local noble, who may or may not be aware of your existence. Because this nobleman never married your mother, you grew up as a commoner and lost his inheritance which, deep in your heart, is rightfully yours.'),
(41, 'Initiate', 'You served as an adept in one of the local temples. While you were being taught the basics of worship, you were gripped by faith. Today you still adhere to this religion and often make offerings to its god.'),
(42, 'Last heir', 'You are the last heir of a noble family that was exterminated by assassins or cut down in a brutal attack or war. Although you lost everyone you loved, you vowed to one day proudly restore your family\'s name. You might even be obsessed with revenge and desperate to find out who is responsible for your family\'s death.'),
(43, 'Librarian', 'In your youth you worked as a librarian for the local temple. You appreciated the calm of life as a librarian and used the opportunity to significantly enrich your knowledge in many areas. But you think you\'re missing out on real life if you continue like this, that\'s why you decided to become an adventurer.'),
(44, 'Lost parent', 'One of your parents (or both, or a brother or sister) has disappeared in a desert region, at sea or in a country distant. When you were old enough to do so, you began searching and this desire to find him fuels every moment of your adventurous life.'),
(45, 'Lumberjack', 'During the winter months of your youth, you worked as a lumberjack. You are comfortable in the forest and rarely get lost there. You know how to handle an ax better than anyone.'),
(46, 'Marked', 'As a child, your family was attacked and you carry the marks of this event with you. Although you don\'t know who was responsible for the attack that killed your parents and scarred your face forever, you remember their crest. One day you will have your revenge.'),
(47, 'Militiaman', 'Before becoming an adventurer, you served as a guard in a city. There you learned the local law, honed your combat skills, and perhaps even arrested a criminal or two, who may have held a grudge against you and may cross your path again one day.'),
(48, 'Mistaken Identity', 'You look like someone who is notoriously famous or infamous (a prince, an evil sorcerer, a sadistic military leader) and, in good or badly, people often treat you as if you were that person. You don\'t know her yet, but one day you will find her.'),
(49, 'Murder in the family', 'Someone in your family has been murdered. The murderer has never been found, but you are driven by the desire to discover the person responsible for this crime and harbor the hope of discovering what his motivation was.'),
(50, 'Orphan of the druidic circle', 'Abandoned in the forest when you were very young, you were adopted by the members of a druidic community. Alongside them, you learned to respect nature and the men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting it. Although you may not have become a Druid, you do what you can to conserve the environment.'),
(51, 'Out of time', 'You do not come from another place, but from another, entirely different era. You were born over 300 years in the future and are familiar with some of the major events currently taking place, events that you considered part of history. Now the story is in front of you, and you are an actor in it. One day, perhaps, you will find a way to return to your time.'),
(52, 'Pact with a devil', 'As a child, your family perished in a fire from which you narrowly escaped. However, during this hell, you prayed and a devil (or other powerful evil creature) answered you. The creature saved you, but in return you promised to do it a great favor later. The day will come when she will remember you, and you are already dreading it.'),
(53, 'Parental debt', 'Your parents owed a large sum to a banker, wealthy landowner, merchant, or nobleman. As they were unable to repay him, they agreed to work for him. However, they are treated unfairly and considered almost like slaves. You have therefore set yourself the goal of recovering enough money to pay off their debt and thus buy back their freedom.'),
(54, 'Political ambition', 'Your family has always played an important political role in your tribe or hometown, perhaps even in the court of a king or queen . You inherited your family\'s ambition and decided to one day replace the current ruler, and you would happily oppose him if he showed signs of weakness or proved unfair or cruel.'),
(55, 'Protected by a thieves guild', 'You were raised and trained by the members of a large thieves guild in a large city. You\'ve learned their trade, committed a lot of petty theft, and may even be wanted by the local authorities. Now you have changed your life, but you know that your past actions or some of your former colleagues could one day cause you serious problems.'),
(56, 'Protected by a tribe of humanoid', 'You were abandoned by your parents and raised by a tribe of orcs, goblins or other similar humanoids ( although you are not of this breed). You have learned to respect them and their ways of life.'),
(57, 'Protector of a sacred place', 'The protector of a sacred place or relic has raised you. Like him, whether he is your parent or your mentor, you played the role of guardian before setting off on your adventure. One day, if this place or relic were in danger, you might be called upon to resume your role as guardian, at least for a while.'),
(58, 'Raised by animals', 'Your parents died in the wild when you were still an infant and an animal or pack (like wolves) raised you. You have developed a special affinity with this breed and have never been comfortable in \"civilized\" places. You may even have problems expressing yourself.'),
(59, 'Revolted', 'When you were a young soldier, you took pity on a man who was condemned to death and disobeyed your lord. You put your life on the line to free this man, because you were convinced of his innocence. The result is that your former lord has offered a reward for your capture and you are now hunted by numerous bounty hunters who have already almost succeeded in capturing you several times.'),
(60, 'Royal heir', 'You are the child and heir of a great leader. One day you will inherit your parent\'s kingdom, but in the meantime you want to prove to the world (and to yourself) that you deserve to be crowned king. You travel in disguise, without bodyguards and without advisors, but with friends and companions.'),
(61, 'Runaway slave', 'You were kidnapped as a child by bandits and sold into slavery. You have then become the property of a rich and evil man who treats his people very badly and forces them to work until exhaustion in his fields. You were able to escape, and you swore to yourself that no one will own you again. But your master wants you back...'),
(62, 'Sacred Mission', 'A high-ranking member of your Church has entrusted you with an important mission. This quest cannot be completed easily or right away. It will take years of research and investigation to uncover the clues that will ultimately lead you to the lost temple or sacred relic you were asked to find.'),
(63, 'Sailor', 'You spent most of your youth serving aboard a merchant ship, noble, or your kingdom\'s navy. You\'re at home at sea, but you\'ve eaten so much fish that you\'ve sworn you\'ll never try it again.'),
(64, 'Sea Rat', 'You are the adopted child of a pirate and his crew. You developed strong bonds with them and mourned when the Royal Navy seized the crew and hanged everyone you knew. Since then, you have distrusted all royal soldiers and the official government.'),
(65, 'Secret heir', 'You were raised by peasants and have lived in the countryside most of your life. But in reality the people who raised you are not your real parents, but the loyal servants of the monarch of your country and you are the child of this monarch and the heir to the kingdom. The problem is you don\'t know it but others do, and a lot of people would pay a lot to see you dead.'),
(66, 'Sent from the past', 'You were born 500 years ago and have, in one way or another, traveled to the future. Instead of looking for a way to return home, you are determined to discover the cause of your family\'s ruin, which, from what you have been able to learn, took place 200 or 300 years ago. Then, perhaps, you will return to your time to change history and thus spare your loved ones.'),
(67, 'Sentenced to death', 'You have been arrested and convicted for a crime that you may or may not have committed. The sentence was death, but you managed to escape before the execution. Now you are on the run and ready to do anything to prove your innocence, even fabricating the evidence.'),
(68, 'Serious handicap', 'You were born with a significant physical handicap, which impairs your strength, dexterity or resistance. Because of this, you walk in a special way and are easily recognized. However, you have learned to cope and have developed other talents. Your aptitude for magic is second to none.'),
(69, 'Servant of nobles', 'You worked for a noble family, tended to their gardens, cleaned their manor or castle, served their meals, and/or repaired their buildings. You know when to smile politely, say “yes sir” and look away.'),
(70, 'Severe past', 'You did serious things when you were younger, perhaps murder. You have since completely changed your way of being and now dedicate your life to the search for truth, justice and the protection of the innocent. However, no matter what you do, you know that what you did will one day come back to haunt you.'),
(71, 'Sewer Rat', 'You grew up in the sewers of a big city. Its maze-like basements have been your only home. But although poor, dirty and poorly dressed, life was not so bad for you, until you decided to come to the surface.'),
(72, 'Slum Society', 'You come from a secret underground society that inhabits the sewers of a major city. The people around you, although generous, live in poverty and are considered a scourge and a shame by the other residents of the town. In fact, they are not even recognized, let alone protected, by local law. Deep in your heart, you know that they deserve a better fate and wish you could do something concrete to change their destiny.'),
(73, 'Soldier of the king', 'From a young age you were trained as a soldier and had served the rulers of your kingdom in their personal guard. You have fought in various battles, perhaps even participated in wars. Either way, they were traumatic experiences that may have hardened your heart against violence, or put you on the path to peace.'),
(74, 'Son of a caravan driver', 'You are the child of a merchant who owns a caravan or of someone who works for such a person (a guard, a cart driver). In your youth, you visited many places and knew half the world. Now you want to see some of these places again.'),
(75, 'Son of a knight', 'You are the child of a knight who swore loyalty to one of the local leaders. You may even be the descendant of a long line of knights and you are willing to do anything to continue in this proud tradition.'),
(76, 'Son of a magician', 'You are the child of a magician and are always at home in libraries and laboratories. Although you may not have developed the ability to wield magical forces as much as your father, you have still learned many complex things related to this inscrutable art.'),
(77, 'Son of a mercenary', 'You are the child of a mercenary, and as a young man you visited many strange places. You never had a home, but your parents always gave you what you needed. You have had a taste for travel since your youth.'),
(78, 'Son of a merchant', 'You are the child of a merchant who owns a modest but successful workshop in a small or large town. You are comfortable in urban environments, but know almost nothing about nature and its way of life. Like your parents, you are probably a charismatic individual who prefers to avoid dark forests and uncivilized mountains.'),
(79, 'Son of a peasant', 'You are the child of a peasant, free or serf, and live on a farm. You are curious about what the world is really like beyond the community you grew up in, and fascinated by the wonderful things you discover on your adventures.'),
(80, 'Son of a Pirate', 'You are the child of an infamous pirate or one of his lesser-known henchmen. You have lived aboard a boat all your life and are very comfortable at sea. Although you may not have followed your father\'s path, you still respect his \'profession\' (it takes courage to be a pirate) and don\'t see piracy as something that needs to be eradicated.'),
(81, 'Son of a priest', 'You are the child of a clergyman and the local temple has always been your home. Although you may not be as devoted as your parents, you still possess a deep respect for their divinity.'),
(82, 'Son of a troubadour', 'You are the child of artists (acrobats, poets, musicians, actors) and have traveled all your life, never staying long at the same location. Like your parents, you feel at home anywhere and make friends very easily.'),
(83, 'Son of a warrior', 'You are the child of a warrior who likely served in your hometown\'s militia or as a guard for a noble. You have admired your father all your life. He was the inspiration that led you to become an adventurer.'),
(84, 'Son of an artisan', 'You are the child of an artisan and live in a small or large town. From a young age, you were naturally trained in the footsteps of your father. But you ultimately decided that his profession, although noble, was not for you.'),
(85, 'Son of barbarians', 'You come from a barbarian tribe and have inherited its traditions and ways of doing things, which many often do not understand. You are proud of this heritage and ardently defend the customs and way of life of your people.'),
(86, 'Son of landowners', 'You are the child of rather wealthy landowners and know that you will inherit these properties one day. In the meantime, you have set out to prove to everyone that your family is worthy of being recognized as noble (or at least of moving up the social ladder).'),
(87, 'Son of nobles', 'You are the child of nobles and very proud of your family, its history and what it represents. You became an adventurer to make your parents proud of you and prove to them that you are worthy of their noble heritage.'),
(88, 'Squire', 'Even if you are not necessarily of noble blood or the son of a knight, you served under the orders of a knight in your youth. There you learned to honor chivalrous virtues, even if you did not subsequently follow the path to knighthood.'),
(89, 'Stable boy', 'In your youth, you worked in the stables of a popular inn, the militia of your hometown or a castle in nobles. You are comfortable with horses, enjoy looking after them, and are probably a skilled rider.'),
(90, 'Stolen heirloom', 'You belong to an old family that has lost its most cherished symbol or talisman (an amulet, a bracelet, a royal crown, a great sword, a mithral breastplate, an old ring, a wooden totem, etc.). This undoubtedly magical heirloom was in your family for generations before someone stole it. You then swore in front of your entire family to find the stolen inheritance.'),
(91, 'Strange birthmark', 'You were born with a strange birthmark of a very particular shape (eye, tree, bear paw, dragon, etc.) . You know that mark must mean something, because a lot of people tell you to hide it. So you don\'t know its meaning, but you are determined to find out.'),
(92, 'Temple Guard', 'You spent your adolescence guarding one of your community\'s local temples. There you learned to respect the cult you served or, on the contrary, you realized that this god and his clergy were a bunch of liars and thieves who did not deserve your respect.'),
(93, 'The foreign child', 'You are a native of a very distant country, and had the misfortune one day to pass through a magical portal which teleported you where you you find now. So you have become an adventurer almost out of obligation, and your goal is to find a way to return home.'),
(94, 'The sins of the father', 'You are the child of a man who was condemned to death. For some reason, the authorities who executed him are now looking for you. Perhaps they believe you know something that could endanger or harm them, or they simply want to exterminate your entire family. Either way, the fact is that they are chasing you.'),
(95, 'Thug', 'As a child, you were part of a gang of thugs in the town where you grew up. You survived thanks to your fists and still think today that the strongest wolf is the one who must lead the pack. Although you now regret the crimes you committed, you are still a boorish and intimidating individual.'),
(96, 'Trapper, hunter', 'You were trained as a trapper or hunter. You are at home in nature, you know how to use a rope, and have learned a thing or two about animal life, which you admire and respect.'),
(97, 'Unjustly accused', 'When you were younger, you were accused of a heinous crime. And although you were declared innocent, people in your hometown still treated you like you were a criminal. You then convinced yourself that you would never be well seen there, and left the city, vowing never to return.'),
(98, 'Unknown parents', 'You have not known your real parents and everyone around you refuses to talk to you about them. From evasive comments and whispered conversations, the only thing you learned was that they were notoriously feared. One day you might learn why.'),
(99, 'Waiter', 'You worked as a waiter in the local tavern or for a large inn near your home village. There you learned to always keep your ears open, and more importantly, to always keep your mouth closed. You\'re probably good at getting information.'),
(100, 'Wild child', 'You grew up in a cave on the side of a hill or in an abandoned cabin in the woods, with your mother who the surrounding population considers to be a witch . Nature is your home, but good manners and social relations are foreign to you.');

(1, 'Aberration', 'Aberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.'),
(2, 'Beast', 'Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.'),
(3, 'Celestial', 'Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.'),
(4, 'Construct', 'Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.'),
(5, 'Dragon', 'Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.'),
(6, 'Elemental', 'Elementals are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.'),
(7, 'Fey', 'Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and  the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.'),
(8, 'Fiend', 'Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.'),
(9, 'Giant', 'Giants tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.'),
(10, 'Humanoid', 'Humanoids are the main peoples of the D&D world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal  form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.'),
(11, 'Monstrosity', 'Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.'),
(12, 'Ooze', 'Oozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.'),
(13, 'Plant', 'Plants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.'),
(14, 'swarm of Tiny Beasts', 'The swarms presented here aren\'t ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even druids can\'t charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.'),
(15, 'Undead', 'Undead are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.');

(82, 'Sorcerous Restoration', 'At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.'),
(83, 'Spell Mastery', 'At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.'),
(84, 'Spellcasting', ''),
(85, 'Stillness of Mind', 'Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.'),
(86, 'Stroke of Luck', 'At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can\'t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.'),
(87, 'Stunning Strike', 'Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent\'s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.'),
(88, 'Superior Inspiration', 'At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.'),
(89, 'Thieves\' Cant', 'During your rogue training you learned thieves\' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves\' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves\' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.'),
(90, 'Timeless Body', 'For a Druid, starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. As a Monk, at 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can\'t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.'),
(91, 'Tongue of the Sun and Moon', 'Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.'),
(92, 'Unarmored Defense', 'As a Barabarian, while you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. As a Monk, beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.'),
(93, 'Unarmored Movement', 'Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.'),
(94, 'Uncanny Dodge', 'Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack\'s damage against you.'),
(95, 'Vanish', 'Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can\'t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.'),
(96, 'Wild Shape', 'Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn\'t have a flying or swimming speed.');

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character\'s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.'),
(2, 'Dwarf', 'Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common threads unite all dwarves.'),
(3, 'Elf', 'Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.'),
(4, 'Gnome', 'A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.'),
(5, 'Half-Elf', 'Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.'),
(6, 'Halfling', 'The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings\' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing tire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.'),
(7, 'Half-orcs', 'Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded ore rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.'),
(8, 'Human', 'In the reckonings of most worlds. humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves. and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that\'s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.'),

And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus - overlord of the Nine Hells - into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children\'s children will always be held accountable.');

COMMENT = 'Defines the different categories to which an item can belong. An item can belong to several categories.' ;

INSERT INTO `category` (`id`, `name`, `description`) VALUES
(1, 'Ammunition', 'Ammunition refers to the projectiles used by ranged weapons. This category encompasses items like arrows for bows, bolts for crossbows, sling bullets for slings, and sometimes specialized projectiles like rocks or darts.  Ammunition is consumed when used, meaning that characters need to acquire and manage their supply.  The type of ammunition used can sometimes affect the damage dealt or other properties of the ranged attack.  While some ranged weapons, like thrown daggers, don\'t strictly use \"ammunition\" in the same way, the term generally refers to the expendable projectiles necessary for most ranged weaponry.'),
(2, 'Arcane focus', 'An Arcane Focus is a specialized tool used by spellcasters, particularly wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, and sometimes bards, to channel their arcane energies when casting spells.  It acts as a tangible representation of their magical power and helps them manipulate the Weave of magic.  Arcane foci can take many forms, such as wands, staves, orbs, crystals, or even specially crafted amulets or rods.  While not strictly required for all spells (some spells have material components that are consumed instead), an arcane focus can often substitute for the material components of a spell if those components don\'t have a specific cost listed.  Using an arcane focus is not the same as providing the material components; it simply allows the caster to bypass the need for those components if they lack a specific gold piece value.  It\'s an important piece of equipment for many spellcasters, both functionally and often as a symbol of their magical abilities.'),
(3, 'Artisan\'s tools', 'Artisan\'s Tools are specialized kits containing the instruments and materials necessary for practicing a specific craft or trade.  This category encompasses a wide variety of tools, such as alchemist\'s supplies, brewer\'s supplies, calligrapher\'s supplies, carpenter\'s tools, cobbler\'s tools, cook\'s utensils, glassblower\'s tools, jeweler\'s tools, leatherworker\'s tools, mason\'s tools, painter\'s supplies, potter\'s tools, smith\'s tools, tinker\'s tools, weaver\'s tools, and woodcarver\'s tools.  Proficiency with a set of artisan\'s tools allows a character to create items related to that craft, perform repairs, or contribute to other relevant tasks.  These tools are essential for characters with crafting backgrounds or those who wish to engage in crafting during downtime.  They can also be used to add flavor and detail to roleplaying scenarios.'),
(4, 'Clothes', 'Clothes can be defined as wearable items not primarily intended for combat or magical protection.  This category encompasses items used for social status, disguise, comfort, utility, and aesthetics, ranging from common tunics and trousers to fine gowns and specialized garb like scholar\'s robes or performer\'s outfits.  Clothing choices reveal character background and personality, influencing social interactions and potentially affecting skill checks.  The cost and availability of clothing vary based on quality and location, adding depth to the game world and enriching roleplaying opportunities by allowing players to express their characters through their attire.'),
(5, 'Container', 'Containers are items designed to hold and transport other objects. This category encompasses a wide range of vessels, from simple pouches and sacks to elaborate chests and locked strongboxes.  Containers serve practical purposes like organizing gear, concealing valuables, and managing encumbrance.  Their size and construction influence their carrying capacity, durability, and security.  Containers can be mundane, like a leather waterskin or a wooden chest, or more specialized, such as a wizard\'s component pouch or a thief\'s lockpicks case.  The contents of a container are typically tracked separately, adding a layer of inventory management to the game, and the security of a container, whether through locks or hidden compartments, can be a factor in adventures.'),
(6, 'Druidic focus', 'A Druidic Focus is a tool used by druids to channel their connection to nature when casting spells.  It\'s a tangible object that represents their attunement to the natural world and helps them manipulate the forces of nature.  Druidic foci can take various forms, such as a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating natural elements like feathers, fur, bones, and teeth.  Like an arcane focus for other spellcasters, a druidic focus can often substitute for the material components of a spell if those components don\'t have a specific cost listed.  It\'s an essential item for druids, both as a functional tool for their magic and as a symbol of their connection to the wild.'),
(7, 'Gaming set', 'This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.'),
(8, 'Heavy armor', 'Heavy Armor is a category of armor designed to provide significant protection in combat.  It is the most protective of the nonmagical armor types, offering a high Armor Class (AC) bonus.  However, heavy armor is also the most cumbersome, imposing penalties on movement and stealth.  Characters wearing heavy armor have disadvantage on Stealth checks, and it often has Strength requirements to avoid further penalties.  Examples of heavy armor include chain mail, splint, and plate armor.  While offering excellent defense, heavy armor\'s drawbacks make it less suitable for characters prioritizing agility or stealth.'),
(9, 'Holy symbol', 'A \"Holy Symbol\" is a sacred object used by clerics, paladins, and sometimes other divine spellcasters to channel divine power and perform miracles.  It serves as a tangible representation of their faith and connection to their deity or divine source.  Holy symbols can take many forms, such as a pendant, amulet, reliquary, or even a symbol etched onto a shield or weapon.  They are often associated with a specific deity or pantheon and may bear their insignia or representational image.  Like an arcane or druidic focus, a holy symbol can often substitute for the material components of a spell if those components don\'t have a specific cost listed.  It\'s an essential item for divine spellcasters, both for its functional use in spellcasting and as a symbol of their devotion.'),
(10, 'Kit', 'A \"Kit\" is a collection of tools and supplies designed for a specific purpose.  Unlike individual tools or artisan\'s tools which are often focused on crafting, kits are more geared toward specific activities or situations.  Examples include an alchemist\'s kit (for brewing potions and concoctions), a burglar\'s pack (for lockpicking and other thievery), a climber\'s kit (for scaling walls and cliffs), a healer\'s kit (for treating wounds and ailments), or a mess kit (for preparing food).  Kits often provide a bonus or advantage when used for their intended purpose, reflecting the convenience and efficiency of having the right tools gathered together.  They streamline certain tasks and are often essential for characters specializing in particular skills or professions.'),
(11, 'Light armor', 'Light Armor is a category of armor that offers basic protection while allowing for greater mobility and flexibility compared to heavier armor types.  Light armor is typically made from supple and lightweight materials like leather or padded cloth. It provides a lower Armor Class (AC) bonus than medium or heavy armor, but it allows the wearer to add their Dexterity modifier to their AC, making it a good choice for agile characters.  Examples of light armor include padded armor, leather armor, and studded leather armor.  Light armor is often favored by rogues, rangers, and other classes that prioritize mobility and stealth.'),
(12, 'Martial Melee Weapon', 'Martial Melee Weapons are weapons designed for close-quarters combat, requiring specific training to wield effectively. This category distinguishes them from simple weapons and ranged weapons. Martial melee weapons encompass a variety of bladed, blunt, and pole-based implements, including swords, axes, hammers, spears, and polearms. They typically deal more damage than simple weapons and sometimes possess special properties like reach or the ability to be used two-handed. Proficiency with a martial melee weapon is often tied to specific classes or feats, reflecting a character\'s combat training.  These weapons are fundamental tools for adventurers, influencing combat tactics and character build choices.'),
(13, 'Martial Ranged Weapon', 'Martial Ranged Weapons are ranged weapons requiring specialized training to use effectively, setting them apart from simple ranged weapons. This category includes weapons like longbows, heavy crossbows, and slings, often dealing significant damage and sometimes possessing properties like increased range or the need for two hands.  Proficiency with martial ranged weapons is usually tied to specific classes or feats, reflecting a character\'s combat training. These weapons are crucial for characters who prefer to engage enemies from a distance, offering tactical advantages in combat.'),
(14, 'Martial Weapon', 'Martial Weapons are a category of weapons that require specialized training to use effectively. This category encompasses both melee and ranged weapons, generally dealing more damage than simple weapons and sometimes possessing special properties.  Proficiency with martial weapons is often tied to specific classes or feats, reflecting a character\'s combat training.  Martial weapons are more complex and diverse than simple weapons, offering a wider range of options for adventurers.  Examples include longswords, great axes, handaxes, scimitars, rapiers, whips (melee), longbows, heavy crossbows, and nets (ranged). They are essential tools for many adventurers, significantly influencing combat tactics and character build choices.'),
(15, 'Medium armor', 'Medium Armor is a category of armor that balances protection and mobility.  It offers a higher Armor Class (AC) bonus than light armor but is less cumbersome than heavy armor.  Medium armor is typically made from materials like hide, chainmail, or scale mail.  It allows the wearer to add their Dexterity modifier to their AC, up to a maximum of +2.  This makes it a good choice for characters who want decent protection without sacrificing too much agility. Examples of medium armor include hide armor, chain shirt, scale mail, and breastplate.  Many classes, such as clerics, bards, and some fighters, find medium armor to be a suitable compromise between defense and maneuverability.'),
(16, 'Melee Weapon', 'Melee Weapon is any weapon designed for use in close combat, where the wielder is typically within striking distance of their target.  This category encompasses a wide variety of implements, including swords, axes, hammers, spears, and polearms.  Melee weapons are used to make melee attacks, which are resolved using Strength for most weapons (or Dexterity for finesse weapons).  They are a fundamental tool for many classes, and the choice of melee weapon can significantly impact a character\'s combat style and effectiveness.  Melee weapons are distinct from ranged weapons, which are designed for attacking at a distance.'),
(17, 'Misc', 'A catch-all category for items that don\'t neatly fit into other classifications.  It\'s a broad category encompassing a wide range of objects that might be found during adventures, purchased from merchants, or crafted by players.  \"Misc\" items can include anything from mundane tools like crowbars and shovels, to unusual trinkets, strange artifacts, or unidentifiable objects of unknown purpose.  These items often serve as props for roleplaying, clues in investigations, or rewards for completing quests.  While they may not always have immediate mechanical benefits, misc items can add flavor and depth to the game world, sparking creativity and driving the narrative forward.  Their value and purpose can vary greatly, often depending on the specific context of the adventure.'),
(18, 'Mixture', 'Mixtures are alchemically created substances with varying effects, distinct from potions or other magical items.  This category encompasses a broad range of concoctions, from volatile explosives and potent poisons to helpful concoctions like fast-drying glue or smokepowder.  Mixtures are often created using alchemist\'s supplies and require specific recipes or formulas. Their effects can be immediate or delayed, and they may have varying degrees of potency or stability.  Unlike potions, mixtures are not inherently magical, relying instead on chemical reactions and the properties of their ingredients.  They add an element of unpredictability and creativity to gameplay, offering both opportunities and risks depending on their use.'),
(19, 'Musical instrument', 'Musical Instrument is an item used to create music. This category encompasses a wide variety of instruments, from simple drums and flutes to complex harps and lutes.  Musical instruments are often used by bards to cast spells, perform for audiences, or provide background music for storytelling and roleplaying.  They can also be used by other classes for entertainment, skill checks involving Performance, or even as tools for distraction or communication.  The quality and type of instrument can influence its cost and effectiveness in performances.  Musical instruments add flavor and cultural richness to the game world, offering opportunities for characters to express themselves creatively and interact with others through music.'),
(20, 'Pack', 'A \"Pack\" is a pre-assembled collection of gear and supplies designed for a specific purpose or profession.  It\'s a convenient way to acquire essential equipment without having to purchase each item individually.  Packs often contain a variety of useful items, such as tools, rations, clothing, and other necessities, bundled together at a generally reasonable price.  Examples include an adventurer\'s pack (containing basic adventuring gear), a burglar\'s pack (for thievery), a diplomat\'s pack (for social encounters), or a scholar\'s pack (for research and study).  Packs streamline the process of equipping characters, especially at lower levels, and provide a thematic set of items appropriate for their background or chosen profession.  While the contents of a pack are fixed, players can often add or remove items as needed.'),
(21, 'Ranged Weapon', 'Ranged Weapon is any weapon designed for attacking targets at a distance.  This category includes a variety of implements, such as bows, crossbows, slings, and thrown weapons.  Ranged weapons allow characters to engage enemies without entering melee combat, offering a tactical advantage.  Attacks with ranged weapons are typically resolved using Dexterity.  The range of a ranged weapon determines how far it can effectively reach, and different ranged weapons have varying damage dice and other properties.  Ranged weapons are a crucial tool for many classes, particularly those specializing in ranged combat. They are distinct from melee weapons, which are designed for close-quarters fighting.'),
(22, 'Shield', 'A \"Shield\" is a piece of defensive equipment designed to be held in one hand or strapped to the forearm to deflect blows and provide additional protection in combat.  Shields grant a bonus to Armor Class (AC), making the wielder harder to hit.  They are typically made of wood or metal and come in various sizes, offering different levels of protection.  Using a shield often requires proficiency, and some shields may have specific restrictions or requirements.  While providing a significant defensive benefit, shields typically occupy a hand, limiting the wielder\'s ability to use two-handed weapons or perform certain actions.  They are a common and effective way for characters to increase their survivability in combat.'),
(23, 'Simple Melee Weapon', 'Simple Melee Weapons are basic, readily available weapons requiring minimal training to use effectively. This category includes common implements like clubs, daggers, quarterstaffs, and sickles. They are generally less expensive and deal less damage than martial weapons.  Simple melee weapons are often the starting weapons for many characters and are accessible to most classes without requiring specific proficiencies.  While not as powerful as martial weapons, they are reliable and versatile, serving as essential tools for adventurers in various situations.'),
(24, 'Simple Ranged Weapon', 'Simple Ranged Weapons are basic ranged weapons requiring minimal training to use effectively. This category includes common implements like darts, slings, and light crossbows. They are generally less expensive and deal less damage than martial ranged weapons. Simple ranged weapons are often accessible to most classes without requiring specific proficiencies and serve as a basic option for characters who prefer to attack from a distance. While not as powerful as martial ranged weapons, they are readily available and can be effective in certain situations.'),
(25, 'Simple Weapon', 'Simple Weapons are a category of readily available and easy-to-use implements for combat.  This category includes both melee and ranged weapons, requiring minimal training to wield effectively.  Simple weapons are generally less expensive and deal less damage than martial weapons.  They are often the starting weapons for many characters and are accessible to most classes without requiring specific proficiencies.  Examples of simple weapons include clubs, daggers, quarterstaffs, sickles, darts, slings, and light crossbows. While not as powerful as martial weapons, simple weapons are versatile and reliable, serving as essential tools for adventurers in various situations.'),
(26, 'Toxin', 'Toxins are substances designed to inflict harmful effects when ingested, inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or injected. This category encompasses a wide range of poisons, venoms, and other noxious substances, each with varying degrees of potency, onset time, and specific effects.  Toxins can be natural, derived from plants or animals, or artificially created. They can be used to incapacitate, weaken, or even kill a creature.  The resistance to a toxin, often determined by a Constitution saving throw, is crucial to surviving its effects.  Toxins play a significant role in the game, appearing in traps, encountered on creatures, and sometimes wielded by villains or even adventurers, adding an element of danger and intrigue to the game.'),
(27, 'Venom', 'Venom is a specific type of toxin produced by certain creatures, often as a means of defense or hunting.  While all venoms are toxins, not all toxins are venoms.  Venoms are typically delivered through bites, stings, or other natural weapons of the creature that produces them.  They often have specific effects tailored to the creature\'s needs, such as paralyzing prey, inflicting pain, or causing rapid tissue necrosis.  The potency and effects of a venom vary greatly depending on the creature.  Overcoming a venom\'s effects usually requires a Constitution saving throw, and failure can result in debilitating conditions or even death.  Venoms are a common threat, adding a layer of danger to encounters with venomous creatures.');

A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals. Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another. These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain.

A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre\'s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses. A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd\'s delight-and his own tactical advantage.

His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness. Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god\'s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin\'s oath is a powerful bond.

Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left. Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive tire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control.

-- Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

COMMENT = 'Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.' ;

-- A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the Player’s Handbook for descriptions of the different alignments. The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you. Some creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature. Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don’t have an alignment.

As long as the excess damage doesn\'t reduce the creature\'s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\'t knocked unconscious.The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\'t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.The target\'s gear melds into the new form.

You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature\'s size is no larger than the object\'s size and the creature\'s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature\'s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object\'s size is no larger than the creature\'s size.

The spell simply takes effect.Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\'t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\'s life drain attack.• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\'s successful save, a foe\'s critical hit, or a friend\'s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\'s current owner.The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\'t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\'t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
